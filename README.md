# DOTNETmicroservices

This is a project to practice building and implementing .NET microservices. It generally follows [binarythistle- S04E03](https://github.com/binarythistle/S04E03---.NET-Microservices-Course-) and associated [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI). For this project I've used MacOS Catalina, and will be hosting my DB in the same location as my [personal website](https://www.thestephaniemiranda.com).

I'll do my best to take notes on challenges I encounter and add them to a Wiki for this project. My goal is to learn how to utilize Docker, Kubernetes and build microservices for .NET ASP.NET Core web applications.

There's a long way to go to finish this project, so let's get rolling!
